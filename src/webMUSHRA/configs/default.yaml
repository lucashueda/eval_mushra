In this study, you will participate in three distinct tests: a <b>naturalness assessment</b>, an <b>emotion similarity assessment</b>, and a <b>speaker similarity assessment</b>. Detailed instructions will be provided at the beginning of each block to guide you through the process. We thank you in advance for your participation.</p><p><i>AIMS Research Group - Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp)</i></p></section>
